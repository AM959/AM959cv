As long as I can remember I’ve always been excited in undergoing new experiences, meeting new people, taking initiative and being a determinant part of a team. I can describe myself as being strongly motivated, full of energy and hope to put into practice all those things that I have learned from my experience as an undergraduate student, as a part of an inspiring team.
